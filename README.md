### USB-C Controlled Power Supply with Arduino 📦

Welcome to the USB-C Controlled Power Supply project, developed for the Picanol Group. This project involves an Arduino Mega board capable of controlling a Ts_AIO-5 card, transforming it into a precise USB-C controlled power supply.

📟 **Key Functionalities**
- **Connection Setup**: Establishing the necessary connections between the Arduino and Ts_AIO-5 card.
- **Current and Voltage Measurement**: Monitoring current and voltage for precise control.
- **Channel Control**: Connecting channels to ground or the bus for desired operations.
- **Voltage Regulation**: Setting specified voltages on the bus as needed.

🖥️ **GUI Component**
The project also includes a GUI, which can be found in the [associated repository](https://github.com/WoutDeleu/PsiControl_GUIAdjustableVoltageSource). This GUI facilitates serial communication between the Arduino and the PC, making it user-friendly and accessible. The cmdMessenger library is utilized to simplify the serial communication process.

⚙️ **Getting Started**
To run and execute the program:
1. Connect the appropriate pins from the Arduino to the Ts_AIO-5 board.
2. Load the corresponding Arduino code onto the board.
3. After the code is uploaded successfully, launch the GUI for control using the built-in serial communication.

👥 **Support and Contribution**
We welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community and the Picanol Group. If you have ideas to enhance this project or encounter issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
